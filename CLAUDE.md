# Relationship Mapper — Claude Code Instructions

## CRITICAL RULES (never break these)

1. **Database is PostgreSQL.** The file `prisma/schema.prisma` MUST have `provider = "postgresql"`. If you ever see `provider = "sqlite"`, stop and fix it immediately. Never change the provider to sqlite.

2. **Never remove datasource URLs from schema.prisma.** The `datasource db` block MUST always contain these three lines:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider  = "postgresql"
     url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
     directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
   }
   ```
   If any of these lines are missing, the build will fail and the live site will break.

3. **Do not change the Prisma generator config.** The generator block MUST stay as:
   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   ```
   Do NOT change it to `prisma-client` or add a custom `output` path. The standard `prisma-client-js` generates into `node_modules/@prisma/client`, which is the only configuration that works reliably on Vercel's serverless environment. The app imports from `@prisma/client` in `src/lib/prisma.ts` — do not change that import path either.

4. **Never push directly to `main`.** All changes go through a pull request from a feature branch. Branch protection is enabled and will reject direct pushes anyway. Follow the workflow in `claude-helpers/Deploy Changes to Live Site.md`.

5. **Always run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` before opening a PR.** CI will run these too, but catching them locally is faster and cheaper.

6. **Do not change `git config user.email`.** Use whatever email is already configured.

7. **Never force-push `main`.** Do not use `git push --force` or `git push -f` against `main`. Force-with-lease is acceptable on your own feature branches (see `claude-helpers/If Something Goes Wrong.md`).

8. **Never commit `.env` or `.env.local`.** Both are gitignored. If you see either staged, unstage it. All production secrets live in Vercel env vars, not in the repo. `.env.example` (tracked) lists every required variable with placeholder values — keep it current when adding new env vars to the app.

## Project Overview

- **App:** Relationship Mapper — tracks people, partners, and connections across offices
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM (Prisma 6, standard `prisma-client-js` generator)
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js (v5 beta)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploys from `main` branch; every PR gets a preview URL)
- **Repository:** Public on GitHub at `ethan-kaseff/relationship-mapper`
- **Node:** 22.x (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Git & Deployment Flow

**Summary:** every change lives on a `work/<slug>` feature branch and reaches production via a PR that passes CI. Vercel auto-deploys `main` and gives every PR a preview URL.

```
  work/fix-foo  ──push──►  GitHub PR  ──CI passes──►  auto-squash-merge  ──►  main  ──►  Vercel deploys
                                                                                   └──►  preview URL per PR
```

Barry and Ethan both use this same flow. Never skip it.

| Barry says | File to read |
|------------|--------------|
| "Let's get started" / start of session / "start work" | `claude-helpers/Before Starting Work.md` |
| "Save" / "commit" | `claude-helpers/Save My Changes Locally.md` |
| "Push" / "deploy" / "push to live" | `claude-helpers/Deploy Changes to Live Site.md` |
| "Something broke" / deploy failed / push rejected | `claude-helpers/If Something Goes Wrong.md` |

## Environment Variables

- `.env.example` (tracked) — documents every required variable with placeholder values. Update this whenever the app starts reading a new `process.env.X`.
- `.env` (gitignored) — local dev values. Real DB/auth credentials live here on each developer's machine.
- `.env.local` (gitignored) — per-machine overrides; takes precedence over `.env`.
- **Vercel** — production / preview / development environment variables live in the Vercel project settings. Use `vercel env pull` to sync them into a local `.env.development.local` for dev parity.

When adding a new integration (Stripe, QuickBooks, etc.):
1. Add the variable to `.env.example` with a placeholder and a short comment.
2. Add it to Vercel for Production (and Preview/Development if needed): `vercel env add`.
3. Add it to the local `.env` / `.env.local` with the real dev value.
4. Reference it in code via `process.env.X`.

## Commands

| `npm run lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint issues |
| `npm run typecheck` | Check TypeScript types |
| `npm test` | Run tests once |
| `npm run db:push` | Sync Prisma schema to database |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open database browser |

## Key Architecture Patterns

### API Routes
All API routes follow this pattern:
1. Authenticate with `requireAuth()` or `requireNonConnector()`
2. Validate request body with Zod schemas from `src/lib/validations/`
3. Query database with Prisma, scoped to the user's office
4. Return JSON response or standardized error via `handleApiError()`

### Prisma Schema Rules
- The generator block must stay as `prisma-client-js` with no custom output (see Critical Rule #3)
- The datasource block must keep `url` and `directUrl` (see Critical Rule #2)
- All models use `@@map("snake_case")` for table names
- All fields use `@map("snake_case")` for column names
- Relations use `onDelete: Cascade` on join tables

### Validation
- Every API route that accepts a body uses Zod schemas from `src/lib/validations/`
- Schemas are re-exported from `src/lib/validations/index.ts`
- When adding new fields to a Prisma model, also update the matching validation schema
